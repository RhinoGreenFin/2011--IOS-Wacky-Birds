2011--IOS-Wacky-Birds
=====================

Partial IOS whack-a-bird game : Due to HD issue, I was unable to recove final copy of the source files.

Description 
====================

Wacky Birds offers 25 challenging wacka-bird levels. Each level increasing in difficulty. You must be fast and precise to earn points to complete the level but be cautious enough not to use up all your lives. Going through each level you want to get points by hitting the birds not the animals that pop out of the ground.
